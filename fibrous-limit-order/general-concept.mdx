Fibrous introduces a hybrid method for managing Limit Orders in the DeFi space, aimed at enhancing transaction security while minimizing gas expenditures. This innovative approach involves storing user orders on an off-chain layer, with execution occurring on-chain only upon order fulfillment. This strategy guarantees optimal price fetching for transactions. Creators benefit from the ability to establish gasless limit orders with a firm commitment. When a taker identifies a corresponding limit order, it can be executed on-chain, culminating in a successful transaction. The hybrid model of Fibrous Finance secures user safety and improves the overall user experience by adeptly merging the strengths of both on-chain and off-chain solutions.
