The user manuals are designed for traders who want to automate their trading activities through the setup of predefined orders that execute once a specific price target is met. Managing these orders is straightforward using the [Fibrous Interface](https://app.fibrous.finance/?tokenIn=0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7&tokenOut=0x053c91253bc9682c04929ca02ed00b3e423f6710d2ee7e0d5ebb06f3ecf368a8).

## Swap at Desired Price

A Limit Order is a commitment to buy or sell a financial instrument at a specified price or better. As a Maker, when you place a Limit Order, you are essentially setting a price at which you are willing to buy or sell, but this order will only be executed if a Taker comes along to fill it.  Fibrous Finance offers a decentralized, aggregated, and seamless experience, managing all liquidity sources across the network to execute trades at the best rates available.

### **How to Create Limit Orders?**

**Step 1: Connect your wallet**

[Connect your Web3 wallet to Fibrous](https://docs.fibrous.finance/fibrous-solutions/fibrous-interface/user-guides/setting-up-a-wallet) and select the network that you would like to use for the swap using the selector at the top right of the Swap page.

**Step 2: Navigate to the limit order page**

On the Swap page, select the "Limit Order" tab within the token exchange interface to access the limit order interface.

**Step 3: Specify your swap pair**

This can be accomplished by manually selecting tokens on the swap screen or by finding the swap pair you want through the search field.

**Step 4: Configure your order amount**

Enter the desired amount into the token box at the top field manually to set your offer. Make sure your wallet has enough balance to fulfill the swap offer.

**Step 5: Configure your order price**

Enter the desired price in the "[Token] at rate" field to determine an estimated amount in the output field. Fibrous will then give you a percentage estimate indicating how the specified price compares to the current market price, showing whether it's more or less favorable to you as the market maker.

**Step 6: Specify the time limit of your order**

Should your order remain unfilled when the specified time limit is reached, it will be cancelled automatically. You have the option to choose from predefined time durations or set a specific expiry time and date yourself. Remember, you also have the ability to manually cancel your order, or any part of it that hasn't been filled, at any point before its expiration.

**Step 7: Token Approving for Contract Spending**

If you're trading this token for the first time on this network, you'll need to select "Approve Order." A prompt will appear from your wallet requesting your permission (a transaction on the blockchain that consumes gas) to allow the Fibrous Protocol's smart contract to carry out transactions with this token on the network. This approval is required only once; future transactions with this token won't need additional permissions, unless the smart contract undergoes an update.

**Step 8: Review and confirm your order**

Select “Review Order” to open the preview screen in a pop-up. If the limit order details meet your approval, proceed by clicking “Confirm Order.”

You will need to confirm this onchain transaction in your wallet.

After confirming the order, it will be visible on the Active Orders screen within the swap interface. By selecting specific orders, you can view the price history for that specified order pair.

When your order is **_completely_** filled it will be moved to the Order History tab of this interface.

## **Cancel Limit Order**

### **How to cancel a specific limit order**
