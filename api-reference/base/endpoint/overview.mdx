# Base API Overview

Welcome to the Base API documentation. Our API provides powerful endpoints for finding optimal trading routes and executing swaps on Base network.

ETH addresses accepted by the API are listed below

| Token | Address                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| ETH   | 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE |
| ETH   | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.fibrous.finance/base
```

## Common Concepts

### Authentication

No authentication is required for the API endpoints.

### Rate Limiting

Please refer to our [Rate Limit](/api-reference/rate-limit) documentation for details about rate limiting.

### Common Token Addresses

Here are some commonly used token addresses on Base:

| Token | Address                                    | Decimals |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| ETH   | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 18       |
| USDC  | 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 | 6        |
| USDbC | 0xd9aAEc86B65D86f6A7B5B1b0c42FFA531710b6CA | 6        |
| WETH  | 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006 | 18       |
| DAI   | 0x50c5725949A6F0c72E6C4a641F24049A917DB0Cb | 18       |

### Response Codes

| Code | Description                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | Success - The request was successful                    |
| 400  | Bad Request - Check your request parameters             |
| 429  | Too Many Requests - You've hit the rate limit           |
| 500  | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

## Available Endpoints

### [Route](/api-reference/base/endpoint/route)

Find the optimal trading route through Fibrous' liquidity pools to maximize output and minimize slippage.

### [Execute](/api-reference/base/endpoint/execute)

Generate calldata for the Fibrous router contract to execute the swap.

### [Calldata](/api-reference/base/endpoint/calldata)

Get the calldata for executing the swap transaction.

## Best Practices

### Slippage Protection

- Always set a reasonable slippage value (0.1% - 1% for stable pairs)
- Use higher slippage for volatile pairs or low liquidity tokens
- Monitor price impact to ensure favorable trades

### Gas Optimization

- Use the `direct` parameter for simple swaps between major tokens
- Set `excludeProtocols` to skip specific protocols if needed
- Consider batch swaps for multiple transactions

### Error Handling

- Always check the `success` field in responses
- Implement proper error handling in your code
- Monitor transaction status after execution

## Quick Start Example

Here's a complete example of how to perform a swap using our API:

1. First, get the optimal route:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fibrous.finance/base/route" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "1000000000000000000",  # 1 WETH
    "tokenInAddress": "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006",
    "tokenOutAddress": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
  }'
```

2. Then, get the execution calldata:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fibrous.finance/base/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "1000000000000000000",
    "tokenInAddress": "0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006",
    "tokenOutAddress": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
    "slippage": 0.5,
    "destination": "YOUR_ADDRESS"
  }'
```

3. Finally, execute the transaction using the returned calldata with your preferred Web3 library.
