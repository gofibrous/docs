# Rate Limit

The rate limit varies based on the load of the API, but generally it's 200 request per minute. This is across all public endpoints and not specific to each endpoint.

To purchase an enterprise rate limit, please send an email to [contact@fibrous.finance](mailto:contact@fibrous.finance) with as many details as possible about your project name, size, and usage requirements.
