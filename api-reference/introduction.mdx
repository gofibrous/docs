## Introduction

Fibrous Router API is a cutting-edge discovery and routing algorithm that offers asset exchanges at the best rates on the market. Our API finds the most efficient paths for token swaps, capable of splitting between different protocols and even different market depths within one protocol in the shortest possible time.

## Supported Networks

Fibrous API is available on multiple blockchain networks:

- **Starknet** - Cairo-based Layer 2 with batch operations support
- **Base** - Optimistic rollup on Ethereum with low fees
- **HyperEVM** - High-performance EVM chain with ultra-fast execution
- **Citrea** - Bitcoin's first ZK rollup with EVM compatibility
- **Monad** - High-performance Layer 1 with parallel execution

For detailed network information, see [Supported Chains](/api-reference/chains-tokens-contracts/supported-chains).

## Core Endpoints

All networks (except Starknet) share the same endpoint structure:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Get Route" icon="route" href="/api-reference/endpoints/route">
    Find the optimal trading route
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Execute Swap" icon="play" href="/api-reference/endpoints/execute">

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Get Calldata" icon="code" href="/api-reference/endpoints/calldata">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Starknet has a different architecture and additional capabilities. See [Starknet API](/api-reference/starknet/endpoint/overview) for details.
  
  V2 API offers enhanced features including integrator fee support, improved response metadata, and new endpoints. Currently available on EVM networks. See [V2 Migration Guide](/api-reference/v2-migration) for details.
</Note>

## Quick Start

Here's a complete example of how to perform a swap:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get the optimal route">
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.fibrous.finance/base/route" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "amount": "1000000000000000000",
        "tokenInAddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "tokenOutAddress": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913",
        "slippage": 0.5
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute the swap">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.fibrous.finance/base/execute" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "route": { ... },
        "slippage": 0.5,
        "destination": "0xYourAddress"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send the transaction">
    Use the returned calldata to send a transaction using your preferred Web3 library.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Base URL

```
https://api.fibrous.finance
```

All endpoints follow the pattern: `/{network}/{endpoint}`

**Examples:**
- `https://api.fibrous.finance/base/v2/route`
- `https://api.fibrous.finance/hyperevm/v2/execute`
- `https://api.fibrous.finance/citrea/v2/calldata`
- `https://api.fibrous.finance/starknet/route`
- `https://api.fibrous.finance/monad/v2/route` (V2 API)

## Authentication

No authentication is required to use the Fibrous Router API. However, rate limits apply to ensure fair usage. 

<Warning>
**API Key Required for Integrator Features**: Partners who want to use integrator features (fee or surplus sharing) on V2 API must obtain an API key from Fibrous. Contact us at [contact@fibrous.finance](mailto:contact@fibrous.finance) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/fibrous) to request an API key. API keys also provide higher rate limits.

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Endpoint-specific data
  },
  "timestamp": 1699564800
}
```

Error responses include detailed information:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY",
    "message": "Not enough liquidity available for this swap amount",
    "details": {}
  },
  "timestamp": 1699564800
}
```

## Best Practices
