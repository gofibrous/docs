## Request Parameters

| Parameter name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| amount * | string | amount of a token to sell, for 1 MON set as `1000000000000000000` |
| tokenInAddress * | string | contract address of a token to sell e.g.: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` |
| tokenOutAddress * | string | contract address of a token to buy e.g.: `0x3bd359c1119da7da1d913d1c4d2b7c461115433a` |
| reverse | boolean | Default `false`. Not supported yet - reserved for future use. |
| direct | boolean | Default `false`. If true, only direct routes (single hop) will be considered |
| excludeProtocols | string | Comma-separated list of protocol IDs to exclude from routing (e.g., "1,2,3") |
| integratorAddress | string | Integrator wallet address to receive fees or surplus. Requires API key authentication. |
| integratorFeePercentageBps | number | Integrator fee percentage in basis points (0-500, maximum 5%). Cannot be used with integratorSurplusPercentageBps. |
| integratorSurplusPercentageBps | number | Integrator surplus percentage in basis points (0-5000, maximum 50%). Cannot be used with integratorFeePercentageBps. |

### Additional Information

`excludeProtocols`: This is where you list the IDs of the AMMs you don't want to include. For example, if there are certain AMMs you prefer not to use due to high fees or other reasons, you simply put their unique IDs in this list as a comma-separated string (e.g., "1,2,3").

`integratorAddress`: When using integrator features, you must provide your API key in the request headers. The integrator address is where fees or surplus will be sent.

`integratorFeePercentageBps` vs `integratorSurplusPercentageBps`: You can use either fee percentage or surplus percentage, but not both in the same request. Fee percentage charges a percentage of the output amount, while surplus percentage shares in the value when routing finds better prices.
