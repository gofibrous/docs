# Monad V2 API Overview

Welcome to the Monad V2 API documentation. Our API provides powerful endpoints for finding optimal trading routes and executing swaps on Monad network.

MON addresses accepted by the API are listed below.

| Token | Address                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| MON   | 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE |
| MON   | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 |

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.fibrous.finance/monad/v2
```

## Common Concepts

### Authentication

No authentication is required for the API endpoints. However, API keys can be used for higher rate limits and integrator fee support.

### Rate Limiting

Please refer to our [Rate Limit](/api-reference/rate-limit) documentation for details about rate limiting.

### Common Token Addresses

Here are some commonly used token addresses on Monad:

| Token | Address                                    | Decimals |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| MON   | 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 | 18       |
| MON   | 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE | 18       |
| WMON  | 0x3bd359c1119da7da1d913d1c4d2b7c461115433a | 18       |

### Response Codes

| Code | Description                                             |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | Success - The request was successful                    |
| 400  | Bad Request - Check your request parameters             |
| 429  | Too Many Requests - You've hit the rate limit           |
| 500  | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

## Available Endpoints

### [Route](/api-reference/monad/endpoint/route)

Find the optimal trading route through Fibrous Finance's liquidity pools to maximize output and minimize slippage.

### [Route and Calldata](/api-reference/monad/endpoint/routeAndCallData)

Find the optimal trading route and generate transaction calldata in a single request. This endpoint combines route finding with calldata generation.

### [Calldata](/api-reference/monad/endpoint/calldata)

Generate transaction calldata for executing a swap using a pre-calculated route from the /route endpoint.

### [Health Check](/api-reference/monad/endpoint/healthCheck)

Check the health status of the Monad V2 API.

## API Version

The Monad V2 API includes version information in all responses via the `meta` field:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "apiVersion": "2.0",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Integrator Features

The V2 API supports integrator fees and surplus sharing:

- **Integrator Fee**: Charge a fee percentage (0-5%) on swaps routed through your integration
- **Integrator Surplus**: Share in the surplus value (0-50%) when routing finds better prices
- **Note**: You cannot use both integrator fee and integrator surplus in the same request

To use integrator features, include your API key in the request headers and specify:
- `integratorAddress`: Your wallet address to receive fees/surplus
- `integratorFeePercentageBps`: Fee percentage in basis points (0-500, max 5%)
- `integratorSurplusPercentageBps`: Surplus percentage in basis points (0-5000, max 50%)

## Best Practices

### Slippage Protection

- Always set a reasonable slippage value (0.1% - 1% for stable pairs)
- Use higher slippage for volatile pairs or low liquidity tokens
- Monitor price impact to ensure favorable trades

### Gas Optimization

- Use the `direct` parameter for simple swaps between major tokens
- Set `excludeProtocols` to skip specific protocols if needed
- Consider batch swaps for multiple transactions

### Error Handling

- Always check the `success` field in responses
- Implement proper error handling in your code
- Monitor transaction status after execution

### Route Freshness

- Routes can become stale within 30-60 seconds
- Always fetch a new route before executing
- Use the `routeAndCallData` endpoint for immediate execution

## Quick Start Example

Here's a complete example of how to perform a swap using our V2 API:

1. First, get the optimal route and calldata:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.fibrous.finance/monad/v2/routeAndCallData" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "1000000000000000000",  # 1 MON
    "tokenInAddress": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "tokenOutAddress": "0x3bd359c1119da7da1d913d1c4d2b7c461115433a",
    "slippage": 0.5,
    "destination": "YOUR_ADDRESS"
  }'
```

2. Then, execute the transaction using the returned calldata with your preferred Web3 library.
