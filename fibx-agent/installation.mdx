description: "Requirements, installation, and authentication methods for the fibx CLI."
---

## Requirements

- **Node.js** v18 or higher
- **npm** (included with Node.js)
- A running [fibx-server](https://github.com/ahmetenesdur/fibx-server) instance for wallet operations

<Note>
  No global installation is needed. All commands use `npx fibx@latest`, which always fetches the most recent version.
</Note>

## Verify Your Environment

```bash
node --version   # Must be v18.0.0 or higher
npm --version
```

## Authentication

FibX requires an active session before performing any wallet operation (balance, send, trade, aave). Two authentication methods are available:

### Method 1: Email OTP (Privy Server Wallets)

This method creates a server-managed wallet through [Privy](https://privy.io). The private key is held securely on Privy's infrastructure and never exposed to the client.

```bash
# Step 1: Request an OTP code
npx fibx@latest auth login user@example.com

# Step 2: Enter the code received via email
npx fibx@latest auth verify user@example.com 123456

# Step 3: Confirm the session is active
npx fibx@latest status
```

### Method 2: Private Key Import

This method uses a locally stored wallet. The private key is encrypted and saved in a local session file.

<Warning>
  Your private key will be stored locally in an encrypted session file. Only use this method on a trusted device.
</Warning>

```bash
# Interactive prompt — paste your private key when asked
npx fibx@latest auth import

# Confirm the session is active
npx fibx@latest status
```

### Session Management

```bash
# Check current session status
npx fibx@latest status

# Get the active wallet address
npx fibx@latest address

# End the session
npx fibx@latest auth logout
```

## Global Options

These flags apply to all commands:

| Flag                | Description                                     | Default |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `-c, --chain`       | Target chain: `base`, `citrea`, `hyperevm`, `monad` | `base`  |
| `--json`            | Output results as JSON (useful for scripting)   | `false` |

### Chain Selection

If no `--chain` flag is provided, all commands default to **Base**.

```bash
# Explicit chain selection
npx fibx@latest balance --chain citrea
npx fibx@latest trade 1 MON USDC --chain monad

# Default: Base
npx fibx@latest balance
```

## First Transaction

After authenticating, run through a complete workflow to verify everything is working:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your balance">
    ```bash
    npx fibx@latest balance
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute a swap">
    ```bash
    npx fibx@latest trade 0.001 ETH USDC
    ```
    The CLI will find the optimal route via Fibrous, simulate the transaction, handle token approvals, and execute.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify the transaction">
    ```bash
    npx fibx@latest tx-status <transaction-hash>
    ```
    This returns the on-chain status, gas used, and a block explorer link.
  </Step>
</Steps>
