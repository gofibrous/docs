While Fibrous provides a whitelist of the most commonly transacted tokens on our platform, you also have the flexibility to search for and add custom ERC20 tokens to the Fibrous interface. Here's how you can do it:

## Step 1: Select the Correct Network

Before you begin, ensure that your wallet is connected to the intended network. The token search function is network-specific and will only display tokens native to the network you're currently using.

## Step 2: Search for the Token

Click on one (or both) of the token selector buttons to open the Token Selection screen. By default, this screen lists all whitelisted tokens. To find a specific non-whitelisted token, use the search bar at the top.

<Note>
You can search for the token by entering its ticker symbol or by pasting its contract address into the search bar.

## Step 3: Import the Token

Once you've located the token you wish to add, click the Import button next to it. A confirmation prompt will appear—click I Understand to proceed.

<Warning>
The custom token is now imported into Fibrous. It will appear under your Imported Tokens list in the token selector screen, and you can now use it for swapping operations.
