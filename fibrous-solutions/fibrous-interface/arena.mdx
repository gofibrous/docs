As Fibrous, we are thrilled to introduce the Fibrous Arena series, an initiative crafted to honor our dedicated users, foster a competitive environment, and integrate our community into Starknet's technology and ecosystem.

The Fibrous Arena series comprises various stages, each with its unique ranking factors. It's our priority to provide a fair and equitable platform where our users can compete across different domains. We are committed to ensuring that each stage of the Fibrous Arena has distinct criteria. Participants are awarded specially designed NFTs based on their ranking categories after every stage. The special abilities of these NFTs will be disclosed later. For now, we recommend our users to keep them safe\!

So far, there have been three stages in the Fibrous Arena series until now:

- **Volume Vanguard:** This stage was based on the trading volume conducted by our users on Fibrous. The top 100 participants received reward NFTs according to their ranking categories.
- **Transaction Titan:** This stage focused on the number of transactions users made on Fibrous, without considering the volume factor. The top 100 participants in this category also received reward NFTs.
- **Winter Swappers:** This stage combined the trading volume and transaction count of our users. Rankings were determined using an Elo rating system, which calculated a combination of trading volume and transaction count.

**The Elo System:** We developed a scoring system where users earned points based on every $1 swapped and each transaction made on Fibrous. The scoring formula is as follows:

P = (Volume x a) \+ (TransactionCount x b)

- P represents the total points achieved by the user.
- Volume is the trading volume of the user (in USD).
- Transaction Count is the total number of transactions conducted by the user.
- a is the points earned per USD, set at 0.0049.
- b is the points earned per transaction, set at 1.5.

Stay tuned for future stages of the Fibrous Arena series. Remember, every transaction you make and every ranking you achieve holds great value to us\!
