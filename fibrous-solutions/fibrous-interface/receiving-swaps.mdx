In the dynamic world of DeFi, Fibrous introduces the **Custom Recipient** feature, enabling users to send tokens directly to an alternate address after a swap. This innovation streamlines the transfer process by combining swap and transfer into a single step, thus saving time and reducing transaction costs for a more efficient, user-centric experience.

## How "Custom Recipient" Works

1. Select the Input Amount
2. Initiate the Swap
3. Adjust Slippage Tolerance
4. Enable Custom Recipient by Swap Settings
5. Enter the Recipient's Address
6. Confirm and Execute

<Warning>
**Important Note:** Setting the recipient address as a centralized exchange, bridge wallet, or an unsupported chain/network may result in the irreversible loss of tokens. Please exercise caution when specifying the destination address to ensure compatibility and the recoverability of your assets.
