Fibrous's Batch Swap feature allows you to input multiple tokens simultaneously and receive an aggregated output, ensuring you get the best price for more than two assets. Thanks to Starknet's Native Account Abstraction (AA), it is possible to manage multiple assets in a single transaction

## How to Use Fibrous Batch Swap?

You can access the Batch Swap via the button top of the swap bar on the middle of the screen.

Next, desire the amount you want to enter for the selected input assets either from the toolbar below them or directly by entering the amount. Once everything is ready, press the "Swap" button located at the bottom.

In the subsequent tab, you can adjust your slippage settings and see the minimum amount you will receive. By pressing the "Confirm" button and approving the transaction in the popup window of the wallet you have connected, you can provide multiple token inputs and their signatures all at once, executing your best-priced transaction.
