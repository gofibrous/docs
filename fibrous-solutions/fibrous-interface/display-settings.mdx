## Rate Comparison Table

Rate Comparison Table is an indicator that allows you to compare exchange rates across multiple liquidity sources in real-time. When you initiate a token swap, Fibrous aggregates rates from various decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and displays them in a convenient table format. This enables you to see which platform offers the most favorable rate for your trade, ensuring you get the best value possible. By providing transparent rate comparisons, Fibrous helps you make informed trading decisions quickly and efficiently.

## Trading Chart

Trading Chart provides a visual representation of the price movements and trading volumes for selected tokens over different time frames. This interactive chart helps you analyze market trends, historical prices, and volatility, aiding in making informed trading decisions. You can customize the chart by:

- Adjusting time intervals
- Viewing candlestick patterns
- Applying technical indicators

The Trading Chart is an essential tool for monitoring the market and planning your trades effectively.

## Show Routing

The Show Routing feature allows you to view the exact path your trade will take across various liquidity pools and exchanges. When you execute a swap, Fibrous may route your transaction through multiple tokens or platforms to secure the best rate. By enabling Show Routing, you gain transparency into this process, seeing each step your assets will pass through. This feature helps you understand how your trade is being executed and ensures confidence in the transaction's efficiency and security.

## Input Kit

The Input Kit refers to the set of tools and options available for entering and adjusting your trade parameters. This includes fields for selecting tokens, inputting the amount you wish to swap, and setting preferences like slippage tolerance and transaction speed.

The Input Kit is designed for ease of use, allowing you to:

- **Directly enter amounts**: Type in the exact number of tokens you want to trade.
- **Use sliders or percentage buttons**: Quickly select common fractions of your balance (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
- **Adjust advanced settings**: Access additional options to fine-tune your trade according to your needs.

## Language Preference

The Language Preference setting allows you to customize the Fibrous interface in your preferred language. By selecting from the available language options, you can navigate the platform more comfortably and understand all features and instructions clearly. This personalization enhances your user experience, making the platform more accessible and user-friendly regardless of your native language.

## Interface Theme

The Interface Theme option lets you personalize the visual appearance of the Fibrous platform. You can choose between different themes, such as light mode or dark mode, depending on your preference or ambient lighting conditions. Adjusting the interface theme can improve readability and reduce eye strain, providing a more comfortable environment for managing your trades.

## Decimal Separator

Decimal Separator setting allows you to select your preferred numerical formatting for decimal numbers displayed on the platform. Depending on your regional settings or personal preference, you can choose between a period (.) or a comma (,) and space as the decimal separator.

This customization ensures that all numerical data, such as token amounts and prices, are presented in a format that is familiar and easily understandable to you, reducing the risk of misinterpretation during transactions.
