---

A Limit Order is a commitment to buy or sell a financial instrument at a specified price or better. As a Maker, when you place a Limit Order, you are essentially setting a price at which you are willing to buy or sell, but this order will only be executed if a Taker comes along to fill it.

**Key Aspects to Understand:**

- **Patience Required:** Your Limit Order will sit on the order book until a Taker decides to execute against it. This could happen quickly or might take some time, depending on market activity and your specified price.
- **Price Guarantee:** Although you must wait for a Taker, you have the advantage of knowing the worst price at which your order can be executed.
- **Market Dependence:** The execution of your order depends on market movements. If the market price moves away from your limit price, your order may remain unfilled unless you adjust the price.

In essence, as a Maker, you provide liquidity to the market, waiting for a Taker to accept your offer. This approach can lead to more favorable pricing but requires patience and a strategic understanding of market dynamics.
