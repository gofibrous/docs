This allows users to access the entire liquidity of these ecosystems through a single, efficient platform, ensuring best-price execution.

## Features and Functionality

<Accordion title="How does Fibrous work?">
  Fibrous functions as a smart router. It scans liquidity and pricing data from all integrated sources across Starknet, Scroll, Base and HyperEVM. For each trade, the algorithm intelligently splits the order across multiple venues to determine the most optimal route. This process guarantees users get the best possible execution price without needing to manually compare sources.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What distinguishes Fibrous from other aggregators?">
  Fibrous is a leading liquidity aggregator with deep integrations into the Starknet, Scroll, HyperEVM and Base ecosystems. Its key distinction lies in combining comprehensive liquidity access with a suite of powerful, user-centric features. Tools like **Batch Swaps** and **Limit Orders** provide traders with enhanced efficiency and greater control, offering a more advanced trading experience than standard aggregators.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What tools does the Fibrous Interface provide to its users?">

## Fees and Costs

<Accordion title="What is the service fee within Fibrous?">
  Fibrous charges a service fee that varies depending on the swap complexity:

  - Single-route swaps: 0.02% fee
  - Multi-route swaps: 0.15% fee

  This fee is automatically deducted from the swap amount. There are no additional fees charged by Fibrous, but standard network transaction fees (gas fees) apply.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any gas fees?">
  Yes, standard network transaction fees apply to all transactions. These fees are required to process transactions on the blockchain and are paid directly to the Ethereum validators and Layer-2 Sequencers, not to Fibrous.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does owning a StarkRock NFT affect fees?">
  Owners of StarkRock NFTs enjoy the benefit of zero service and gas fees on Fibrous. StarkRocks holders will not pay any fees when using Fibrous.
</Accordion>

## Security

<Accordion title="Is Fibrous storing my tokens?">
  Fibrous does not store your tokens. As a non-custodial platform, all your assets remain in your wallet until you execute a transaction. Tokens are transferred directly through smart contracts during your trades, ensuring you maintain control over your funds.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is slippage?">
  Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the final price at which it is executed. It commonly occurs for three reasons:

  - **Market Volatility:** Rapid price movements between the time a transaction is submitted and confirmed.
  - **Liquidity Changes:** Large trades that affect the asset balance within a liquidity pool.
  - **Network Congestion:** Delays in transaction confirmation on the blockchain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I prevent slippage?">
  You can minimize slippage by:

  - Setting a slippage tolerance in the Fibrous interface
  - Executing trades during stable market conditions
  - Using Limit Orders to specify exact execution prices
