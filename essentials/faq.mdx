## General

<Accordion title="What is Fibrous?">
  Fibrous is an advanced DEX aggregator and liquidity hub for the Starknet, Citrea, Monad, HyperEVM, and Base ecosystems. It operates by scanning all available liquidity sources, intelligently splitting trades across them to find the optimal price and route for any swap. This allows users to access the entire liquidity of these ecosystems through a single, efficient platform, ensuring best-price execution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Does Fibrous have a native token?">
  Currently, Fibrous does not have a native token. The project's primary focus is on delivering the best aggregation service to its users. Any future updates regarding a token will be announced through official Fibrous channels.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where can I find the Fibrous community?">

</Accordion>

## Features and Functionality

<Accordion title="How does Fibrous work?">
  Fibrous functions as a smart router. It scans liquidity and pricing data from all integrated sources across Starknet, Citrea, Monad, Base and HyperEVM. For each trade, the algorithm intelligently splits the order across multiple venues to determine the most optimal route. This process guarantees users get the best possible execution price without needing to manually compare sources.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What distinguishes Fibrous from other aggregators?">
  Fibrous is a leading liquidity aggregator with deep integrations into the Starknet, Citrea, Monad, HyperEVM and Base ecosystems. Its key distinction lies in combining comprehensive liquidity access with a suite of powerful, user-centric features. Tools like **Batch Swaps** and **Limit Orders** provide traders with enhanced efficiency and greater control, offering a more advanced trading experience than standard aggregators.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What tools does the Fibrous Interface provide to its users?">
  - **Integrated TradingView Charts:** For advanced price analysis.
  - **Transaction History:** To easily track and review past trades.
  - **Portfolio Tab:** A clear overview of asset balances and positions.
  - **Advanced Trading Tools:** Features like Batch Swap and Limit Order for sophisticated strategies.
  - **Slippage Tolerance Control:** Customizable settings for precise trade execution.
  - **Real-Time Price Updates:** Live data from all integrated liquidity sources.
  - **Fibrous AI:** A tool that allows users to customize their trading experience using natural language prompts.
</Accordion>

## Fees and Costs

<Accordion title="What is the service fee within Fibrous?">
  Fibrous charges a service fee that varies depending on the swap complexity:

  - Single-route swaps: 0.02% fee
  - Multi-route swaps: 0.15% fee

  This fee is automatically deducted from the swap amount. There are no additional fees charged by Fibrous, but standard network transaction fees (gas fees) apply.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any gas fees?">
  Yes, standard network transaction fees apply to all transactions. These fees are required to process transactions on the blockchain and are paid directly to the Ethereum validators and Layer-2 Sequencers, not to Fibrous.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does owning a StarkRock NFT affect fees?">
  Owners of StarkRock NFTs enjoy the benefit of zero service and gas fees on Fibrous. StarkRocks holders will not pay any fees when using Fibrous **only on Starknet**.
</Accordion>

## Security

<Accordion title="Is Fibrous storing my tokens?">
  Fibrous does not store your tokens. As a non-custodial platform, all your assets remain in your wallet until you execute a transaction. Tokens are transferred directly through smart contracts during your trades, ensuring you maintain control over your funds.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is slippage?">
  Slippage is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the final price at which it is executed. It commonly occurs for three reasons:

  - **Market Volatility:** Rapid price movements between the time a transaction is submitted and confirmed.
  - **Liquidity Changes:** Large trades that affect the asset balance within a liquidity pool.
  - **Network Congestion:** Delays in transaction confirmation on the blockchain.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I prevent slippage?">
  You can minimize slippage by:

  - Setting a slippage tolerance in the Fibrous interface
  - Executing trades during stable market conditions
  - Using Limit Orders to specify exact execution prices
</Accordion>
