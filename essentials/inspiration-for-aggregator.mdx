## The Need for a DEX Aggregator

The promising realm of DeFi has faced challenges due to the compartmentalized operations of individual decentralized exchanges, each functioning within its own isolated environment. Despite possessing ample liquidity, these isolated operations frequently lead to suboptimal user experiences, resulting in complications such as slippage and significant price impacts, especially during high-volume transactions.

Recognizing the need to address this fragmented landscape, Fibrous was conceived as a comprehensive platform designed from the outset to cohesively unite these diverse DEXs and price solvers. By harnessing their strengths and mitigating their weaknesses, Fibrous aims to deliver an enhanced swapping experience that is both seamless and optimized for all users.

## Fibrous' Innovative Solution

As various scalability solutions emerge—leading to fragmented liquidity across different networks—the need for optimal on-chain trading execution has become paramount. Furthermore, Fibrous has been developed not only to serve Automated Market Makers (AMMs) but also to create a comprehensive DeFi execution hub for Private Market Makers (PMMs) and the solver ecosystem.

By leveraging the capabilities provided by efficient verifiable computation and Account Abstraction (AA), particularly on the Starknet network, Fibrous's core function is to construct complex trading routes and offer them to DeFi users with a single click.

## Advantages for Users

Fibrous distinguishes itself in the DeFi space by offering a suite of user advantages:

### Simplified Process
It eliminates the manual and often cumbersome task of searching Starknet for the best liquidity and price points. Instead, Fibrous utilizes a sophisticated optimized order routing algorithm that intelligently distributes users' funds across various liquidity sources, securing the most competitive prices.

### Mitigated Price Impact
The platform's advanced trading strategy significantly reduces the "price impact" typically associated with decentralized exchanges (DEXs), leading to improved trade profitability.

### Reduced Slippage
Slippage rates are substantially lowered with Fibrous, a feature especially advantageous for large-volume trades.

### Unified Interface
Fibrous aims to integrate all liquidity sources in a network into a cohesive and unified interface, offering a streamlined, efficient, and user-centric trading experience.

### User-Centric Feature Set
Beyond basic swap transactions based on best execution, Fibrous provides users with a comprehensive trading environment through features like Batch Swap and Limit Order, which offer better portfolio management and price control.
